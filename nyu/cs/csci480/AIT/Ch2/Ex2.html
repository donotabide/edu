    /* 
    Write a program that uses console.log to print all 
    the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For 
    numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the 
    number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), 
    print "Buzz" instead.
    When you have that working, modify your program to 
    print "FizzBuzz", for numbers that are divisible by 
    both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for 
    numbers divisible by only one of those).
    (This is actually an interview question that has been 
    claimed to weed out a significant percentage of 
    programmer candidates. So if you solved it, youâ€™re 
    now allowed to feel good about yourself.)
