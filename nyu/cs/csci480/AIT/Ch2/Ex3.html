        Write a program that creates a string that represents 
        an 8×8 grid, using newline characters to separate 
        lines. At each position of the grid there is either a 
        space or a “#” character. The characters should form 
        a chess board.
        Passing this string to console.log should show 
        something like this:
         #  #  #  #
           #  #  #  #
         #  #  #  # 
           #  #  #  #
         #  #  #  #  
           #  #  #  # 
         #  #  #  # 
           #  #  #  #
        When you have a program that generates this pattern, 
        define a variable size = 8 and change the program so 
        that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the 
        given width and height.

            var hashTags2 = "";
            for(var i=0; i < size; i++){
                if(i%2){
                    hashTags1+=" ";
                    hashTags2+="#";
                } else{
                    hashTags1+="#";
                    hashTags2+=" ";
                }

                console.log(hashTags2);
